                Christ the Redeemer, a colossal statue of Jesus, stands atop
                Mount Corcovado in Rio de Janeiro. Its origins date to just
                after World War I, when some Brazilians feared a “tide of
                godlessness.” They proposed a statue, which was ultimately
                designed by Heitor da Silva Costa, Carlos Oswald, and Paul
                Landowsk.

                The Colosseum in Rome was built in the 1st century by the
                emperor Vespasian. It could hold 50,000 spectators who watched a
                variety of events like gladiator fights. Men battling animals
                was also a famous event watched there. So many animals were
                killed there that many species became extinct.

                Great might be an understatement. This one of the world's
                largest building-construction projects is 5,500 miles long. A
                disputed Chinese study, however, claims the length is 13,170
                miles. The work started in the 7th century BCE and continued for
                two millennia.

                The ancient city of Petra, Jordan, is located in a remote
                valley, nestled among sandstone mountains and cliffs. It was
                purported to be one of the places where Moses struck a rock and
                water gushed forth. Later the Nabataeans, an Arab tribe, made it
                their capital, and during this time it flourished, becoming an
                important trade center, especially for spices.

                Spanish rule. Although that claim was later disproved, the

                This mausoleum complex in Agra, India, is regarded as one of the
                world’s most iconic monuments and is perhaps the finest example
                of Mughal architecture. It was built by Emperor Shah Jahān
                (reigned 1628–58) to honor his wife Mumtāz Maḥal (“Chosen One of
                the Palace”), who died in 1631 giving birth to their 14th child.
                It took about 22 years and 20,000 workers to construct the
                complex.
